      content: "Our aristocratic apartment - Óváros Residence - is located right in the middle of Veszprém, on Óváros tér, the expression „everything is within arm's reach” is not a marketing ploy: the Veszprém Castle, the Heroes' Gate, the Fire Tower, Dubniczay Palace, St. Michael's Cathedral are a 2-minute walk away available. Óváros tér is the beating heart of Veszprém. In addition to numerous attractions, it is home to events such as the Jazz, Rozé, Riesling Festival, and the Old Town Farmers' Market takes place here on Sundays. The Óváros Residenc offers an unparalleled view of the historic city center, street noise does not disturb relaxation, as it is largely a pedestrian zone. There are many cafés and restaurants in the area, for example the Historia Hangvilla Restaurant and Café with a daily menu, or the award-winning Malomkert Sörházat with an a'la carte menu and home-brewed beers."

        • You like to take care of the food (breakfast, lunch, dinner) according to your own taste. Our fully equipped kitchen and dining room will help you with this.


        • You would retreat a little from the hectic everyday life in an intimate way. The check-in and check-out and the operation of the locks are done with the help of a mobile application. The caterers are of course available by phone if necessary, but it is not necessary to meet them in person on-site.


        • You like huge private spaces.


        • Proximity to the city center and attractions is important to you.

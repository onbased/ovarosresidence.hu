    ### Things to know

     I would like to share with you some important information about the accommodation.

    
     • Accommodation can be booked from 2:00 p.m. on the day of arrival, and the apartment is available until 10:00 a.m. on the day of departure.
    
    
     • Entry to the building is possible with a door opening code at Óváros tér 2.
    
    
     (Entrance is possible from the back bypassing the KUNSZT café)
    
    
     • To get into the apartment and the house, we send a code via SMS before arrival. The door opening code is automatically deleted at 11:00 a.m. on the day of departure.
    
    
     • Parking is available in the area for a fee. However, we provide free parking in the courtyard of the nearby HOTEL HISTORIA (8200 Veszprém Toborzó utca 11-13), which is monitored by an internal camera.
    
    
     • The accommodation fee does not include the local tourist tax, which is HUF 500/person/night, which must be paid on site in cash or by bank transfer.
    
    
     • For programs and attractions in the area and in Veszprém, contact the colleagues of the Tourinform store on the ground floor of the building, who will be happy to help.

    
     If you have any further questions or requests, I am at your disposal!
